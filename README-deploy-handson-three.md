# Lesson 3 Hands-On  (13 points)

## Directions

For this Hands-On, you will continue to work with the `todo-list` project
you used in the Lesson 1 and 2 Hands-Ons. `This Hands-On will be graded`,
so be sure you complete all requirements.

---

## Setup

* You will be working with your `deployment-handson-two` project for this Hands-On.

    * Make a copy and rename it `deployment-handson-three`.
    
## Requirements

* Make sure the `deploy.js` file for this project matches the `hackathon-starter`
deploy.js file.

    * **IMPORTANT:** Make sure to change the `hackathon-starter-temp` and
    `hackathon-starter` naming conventions to `riot-express-todo-list-temp` and
    `riot-express-todo-list` where needed.

* Add the `.sh` file

* Add the `.yml` file

* Connect Travis CI to the `todo-list` repository

* Update `.yml` file

Make a change to the file to be sure that Travis CI is automatically deploying
your project.
